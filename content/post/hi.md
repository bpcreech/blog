I'm a blog sans database?

<!--more-->

## This site

You have happened across Ben Creech's web presence. This web presence is currently in blog form, which implies content will appear here with a regularity which I can assure you *is highly unlikely to occur*.

Mostly this is just a place for me to throw stuff on the interwebs.

This is a static site whose source [lives on Github](https://github.com/bpcreech/blog) and whose content is hosted on Github pages. It's generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). More on that in another post, maybe.

## Me

My name is Ben! I live in the part of NYC we call "Jersey City" with my lovely wife and two [sentient mops](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProperAnimalNames/comments/10tal63/sentient_mop/). I like science fiction, jazz, and programming the machines who will, one day soon, [feed us and clothe us and compose our smooth jazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3meRSfFsCkc).

I'm a Software Engineer, in the ~~dark~~ management side of the business since 2014.

You can find my resume at http://tinyurl.com/bpcreech.
