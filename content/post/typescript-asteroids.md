In 2010 Doug McInnes [made](https://github.com/dmcinnes/HTML5-Asteroids)
[this cool JavaScript+HTML5 Asteroids clone](http://www.dougmcinnes.com/2010/05/12/html-5-asteroids).
I've
[converted it to TypeScript](https://github.com/bpcreech/typescript-asteroids);
it's live [here](https://bpcreech.com/asteroids/)!

## Asteroids

[Asteroids](https://www.arcade-museum.com/Videogame/asteroids) is one of my
favorite video games. Many years ago, the daycare I grew up in (!) had an
original tabletop Asteroids game for us munchkins to play with. I spent hours on
that thing instead of playing sportsball or getting vitamin D. Asteroids is
super cool in both its simplicity, and its use of vector graphicsâ€”as in, the
original CRT didn't just do the horizontal scan thing; the tube traced out the
vector pattern on the screen, resulting in things like small shapes showing up
brighter.

So I have spent random minutes playing
[Doug McInnes's JS asteroids clone](https://github.com/dmcinnes/HTML5-Asteroids)
to reset my brain, for years since he first published it back in 2010.

## TypeScriptification

I wanted to play with ML reinforcement learning (more on that below), which
requires me first to do some code refactoring on the game. Notably, to do
training I want to be able to programmatically:

1. Reset the game,
2. Single-step the game loop,
3. Seed the RNG,
4. Extract internal state for observation, and
5. Decouple UI from business logic, so we can run the game logic without a full
   browser (for both simplicity and speed).

I'm not a good enough JS programmer to safely refactor piles of raw JS, so ...
[I converted it to TypeScript](https://bpcreech.com/asteroids)!

This uses:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to manage the dev and build toolchain,
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting,
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for formatting, and
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for CI/CD.

## ML reinforcement learning??

**This is still a TODO and will get another post if I manage to operationalize
anything.**

My weird idea is to replace the game's demo screen with a live machine-operated
game, maybe operated by [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js). There
has already
[been extensive research in training robots to play Asteroids](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/atari/asteroids/);
what I want to try differently here is specifically train on this
browser-playable game.
